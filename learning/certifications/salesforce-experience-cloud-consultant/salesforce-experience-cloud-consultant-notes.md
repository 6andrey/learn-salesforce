You can also use personas to help you articulate who you're not designing for. In some cases, a feature isn’t used by all of your users, and it is helpful to explicitly acknowledge that this group of users doesn’t need to be considered in the design process.

It’s totally OK if at your organization one user maps to multiple personas!

A user story describes a specific task or activity using one of your personas. A user story is told from the persona’s perspective. It includes the persona, one of their top activities, and their motivations and goals to provide more context and make the story come to life.

> As as  [Persona name]  I want to  [Task I want to do]  so that I  [Impact of completing this task].

`“A (primary) persona must be satisfied by the particular UI, and cannot be satisfied by another persona’s UI.” —Alan Cooper`

Key places where personas can add real value to your company:

1. Smarter roadmap decisions: pusrchasing and licensing, custom features
2. Tailoting user enagagement: trainings, events, activities with users
3. Targeted research: selecting right participants to test `specific` features

### [Community Persona Cards](https://developer.salesforce.com/files/community-persona-cards.pdf?_ga=2.232150359.993844698.1659361337-742205375.1652543223)

### [Search Basics for Experience Builder Sites](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/comm_search_basics)

Expanding search results

- Lemmatization - helps users find different forms of a word
- Spelling Correction
- Expanded Queries - If a search term gets no results, this feature finds matches where the search term is part of a word
- AND/OR Searching - first run AND search, if not many results, then run OR search

The relevance of search results

* How many times the search term appears in the record (The more often, the better.)
* Which fields the search term appears in. (Name, title, and subject fields are important.)
* Whether the customer owns the record. (We assume customers want to see the ones they own first.)
* How often the customer views or edits the record. (Again, the more often, the better.)

Global Search Results component can:

- make almost any object searchable in the site. External sources can be added.
- search filtering, to refine the results
- add `All Results` tab to see the best matches

Global Search for Peer-to-Peer Communities component - set up **autocomplete** feature.

Set up **Synonyms Groups**:
> Setup -> Synonyms -> click `New` to start a synonym group

Add search results from external sources - details [here](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=search_federated_parent.htm&language=en_US&_ga=2.128479556.993844698.1659361337-742205375.1652543223)

Community Management Package - install from AppExchange
- view search activity on Community Search Dashboard
  * most searchable terms
  * terms not getting any results
  * type of memmbers searching for the term

[Configure Features with Guided Setup](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.networks_guided_setup_intro.htm&type=5&_ga=2.236525897.993844698.1659361337-742205375.1652543223)

As long as you have a Partner license, you can access Guided Setup from Experience Workspaces. 

## Sharing, Visibility, and Licensing
Exam Weight 17%

### [Control Which Users Experience Cloud Site Users Can See](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.networks_user_sharing.htm&type=5&_ga=2.250058630.1494336318.1659882292-742205375.1652543223)

User sharing lets you decide whether all users in an Experience Cloud site are visible to each other.
Settings to consider when setting up sharing for external users:

1. Portal User Visibility - if enbled, portal users in the same customer or partner portal account can see each other, regardless OWD, and see SF users that owns the portal account
2. Site User Visibility - if enabled, `See other members of this community` can set ON or OFF, on community-by-community basis
3. Guest User Visibility - `Let guest users see other members of this site` - grant guest user visibility on a site-by-site basis

Change org settings:
> Setup -> Sharing Settings -> Edit -> `Enable Portal User Visibility` or `Site User Visibility` -> Save

Manage user and guest user visibility on a sity-by-site basis:
> Setup -> Digital Experiences -> Click `Workspaces` on a site -> Click `Administration` -> `Prefernces` -> Select `See other members of this site` or `Let guest users see other members of this site` -> Click Save

Site User Visibility Best Practives for Guest Users

* Hide `Knowledgeable Users` and `Reputation Leaderboard` components to protect identity of most active users
* Never use `View All Users` permission for guest users
* Never use the `Site User Visibility` in Sharing Settings
* Enable `See other memebers on this site` on a site-by site basis to give users visibility to site users
* Don't use the `Site User Visibvility`, if a community must remain private. Instead use sharing rules or sharing sets on the user record to open up user visviljry where needed 
* Consider using nicknames to protect identity of a site's members
* Restrict exposed fields on a user profile layout to a minimum

### [Set Up Salesforce Knowledge](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/set-up-salesforce-knowledge)

Project

### [Share CRM Data with Your Partners](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/communities_share_crm_data)

Project

Object that can have an external sharing model

- Accounts and their associated contracts and assets
- Assets
- Cases
- Contacts
- Individuals
- Opportunities
- Orders
- Custom Objects
- Users

Salesforce creates and maintains the following site-specific groups

- Portal roles
- Portal role and subordinates
- Roles, Internal and Portal Subordinates
- All Customer Portal Users and All Partner Users public groups
- And if you have channel programs and levels set up, you have Channel Programs and Levels Groups

### [Experience Cloud User Licenses](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.users_license_types_communities.htm&type=5)

Licenses used for external user

* Customer Community - B2C experiences w. large numbers of external users who need access to Case objects or Knowledge. Can be used w. Personal Accounts.
* Customer Community Plus - B2C experiences w. external users who need access to reports and dashboards, and need standard sharing. Can be used w. Personal Accounts.
* Partner Community - B2B experiences that need access to sales data such as PRM. Cannot be used w. Personal Accounts.
* External Apps - custom digital experiences to engage any external stakeholder, incl. Brand Engagmenent and Customer Loyalty. Limited access to CRM objects. Can be used w. Personal Accounts.
* External Identity - to deliver identity services. User with the external identity license can be upgraded to a community license at any time.
* Channel Account - B2B sites and portals that calculate their usage based on number of partners instead of inidividual users.

Each community license can be either

- member-based
- login-based - purhase a number of logins to be used every month. Logging in multiple times a day for a user counts as one login. Swithcing between sites doesn't comsume extra logins. The timeout period for a session is configurable up to max = 24 hrs.

Users with the `Create and Set Up Experiences` permission automatically have full admin access to `Experience Builder`

Unauthenticated or guest users who access your Experience Cloud site do not use up any of your external licenses.  
Page views are limited for guest users:
Enterprise edition - 500,000/month
Unlimitied edition - 1,000,000/month

### [Configure an External Account Hierarchy](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.220583832.1494336318.1659882292-742205375.1652543223&type=5&id=sf.networks_external_account_hierarchies.htm)

External account hierarchies work like Salesforce role hierarchies. Account records, owned by users with roles in child accounts that are part of an external account hierarchy, share data with the parent accounts in that hierarchy. As a result, data can be shared without creating sharing rules.

1. [Enable external account hierarchies in your org](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=exp_cloud_setup_ext_acc_hierarchy_settings.htm&type=5&language=en_US)
   > Setup -> Digital Experiences -> Settings -> Select `Enable External Account Hierarchy` -> Save
2. Click `New` to create a hierarchy
3. To create a level within your hierarchy, click `Add Child Account`, then check `Activate`.
4. Hierachy can up to 5 levels deep

### [Data Security](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data_security)

(General SF Admin knowledge, not specific to Experience Cloud)
#### Levels of Data Access

- Organization - uathorized users, password policies, login limits, etc.
- Objects - set access on Profiles or Permission Sets / PSGs
- FLS
- Records
  - OWD - lock down data to the most restrictive level
  - Role Hierarchies - give access to users up in hierarchy to records owned by users down in hierarchy
  - Sharing Rules - automatic exceptions to OWD
  - Manual Sharing

## User Creation and Authentication

Exam Weight 13%

### [Create Experience Cloud Site Users](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.40087713.2093328585.1659960874-1909944366.1653933554&type=5&id=sf.networks_create_external_users.htm)

|User Permissions Needed|Permission|
|-|-|
|To create/edit Cuatomer Community Plus or Partner Community users|Manage External Users|
|To creare/edit only Customer Community Plus users|Manage Customer Users|
|To log in as community user|(Manage External Users or Manage Customer Users) and Edit on Accounts|

### [Add Members to Your Experience Cloud Site](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.149217078.1494336318.1659882292-742205375.1652543223&type=5&id=sf.networks_customize_members.htm)

Use profiles and permission sets to manage site membership during the setup process. Adding a profile or permission to a site’s membership gives access to the site to users with that profile or assigned the permission set. Permission Set Groups can't be used.

Other options for granting access to your site:

- Enable self-registration so that external users can register on their own
- Enable authentication providers, such as Facebook, so that external users can log into the site without creating an account

#### Set Custom Site Roles

Experience Cloud site members are typically assigned the role of partner, customer, or employee. However, you can create custom roles for users that replace standard ones. You can also choose to display the member’s company name in place of a role.

To create custom roles Experience Cloud sites:

1. Setup -> Digital Experiences -> All Sites -> Workspaces
2. Administration -> Members
3. Site Role -> Custom 
4. Enter new name to use instead of the role name
5. Save

### [Delegate Management to External Users](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.50189478.1494336318.1659882292-742205375.1652543223&type=5&id=sf.networks_del_external_user_manager_intro.htm)

If your partner organizations have many users, you can delegate user administration to external users, who can:

* Create and edit external user records
* Generate new passwords for external users
* Disable Existing excternal users
* Manage permission sets for external users in their account

#### Delegated Account Management

Give external users the power to manage account members and account brand information. Delegated account managers can create and edit a member, reset a member’s password, and activate or deactivate a member. They can also upload brand logos and save company information for co-branded email templates to partner users, marketing campaigns, deal notifications, and websites.

External users who have been granted delegated external user administration rights can access Account Management.

#### Allow External Users to Manage Other Accounts with Account Switcher

And authorize access to manage the other accounts’ users - add `Manage Users` access.
With `Authorized Access`, the managing user of an external managed account can manage permission sets for other users, reset passwords, activate, deactivate, or add members to the target account.

### [Securely Share Your Experience Cloud Sites with Guest Users](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.252624009.1494336318.1659882292-742205375.1652543223&type=5&id=sf.networks_secure_community.htm)

When this policy is fully enforced, any public-facing site must follow these rules.

* Securing access to records by guest users: guest user external OWD always set to private, guests must only have read access, can't be members of public groups or queues, can't access to records vis manual sharing, can only get access to recors via `guest user sharing rules`
* Assigning new records created by geuest to a default owner in your org
* Viewing other members of a publicly available site - guests can't be assigned ti `View All Users` permission; your org can access member visibility on a site-by-site basis

#### Give Secure Access to Unauthenticated Users with the Guest User Profile

Use a guest user profile to control public access to data, content, and objects in your site that don't require authentication. For example, you can create a customer support community where existing and potential customers can view public discussions, known issues, and solutions posted by other members or support without logging in. Salesforce creates a profile, a user record, and sharing mechanisms that are available only to guest users, regardless of whether the site is configured for public access. All guest visitors to a public site share the same guest user record (one per site) and have the same access level.

General Best Practices and Considerations when configuring the guest user profile:

- The guest user profile is specific to the paricular Experience Cloud site
- If a sit is active, guest users can access a subset of its pages, such as login and error pages
- Review object settings, permissions sets, PSGs, PS lisenses assigned to guest users
- Review all system permissions
- etc...

#### SEO Best Practices and Considerations for Guest Users

To configure your site for search engine optimization (SEO), Salesforce uses the guest user profile to identify the public pages and objects available for indexing. A search engine is considered a guest, or unauthenticated, user. For Experience Builder sites, Salesforce automatically generates a sitemap with a list of the publicly accessible content. For sites built with Salesforce Tabs +Visualforce, you are responsible for creating the sitemap and indicating which pages are included.

#### Control Public Access to Your Experience Builder Sites

Best Practices:

* Don’t create object pages for objects that aren’t exposed to external users. If you have object pages that aren’t being used, delete them.
* Use specific object pages when possible. These pages make public URLs more discoverable to your users.
* If you set up object pages for authenticated users, test the pages to ensure that guest users can’t see them.
* Review page access settings for the search page to ensure that you want the search page accessed by guest users.
* To limit access to the search page, consider creating a search page variation with a guest audience.
* Guest users only see results on objects they have access to.
* Actual record access for the guest user isn’t limited to the objects the admin configures in the Global Search Results component. The guest user can have access to other objects based on org sharing configurations.
* Always check the org’s sharing model (including org-wide defaults and sharing rules) to ensure that the guest user doesn’t have access to your org’s sensitive data.

#### Object-Specific Security Best Practices for Guest Users

* To assign or remove Chatter-specific permissions to guest users, check System Permissions in the guest user profile.
* Give only internal and trusted members the ability to create groups. Consider a group creation workflow with an approval process.
* Keep the number of groups to a minimum, and audit your site’s groups on a regular basis.
* Keep groups private whenever possible.
* Consider a process on who can manage groups.
* Make sure that the content in the group detail page meets your site’s content standards.
* Review files that are publicly accessible and associated to groups to make sure that they meet your site’s content standards.
* Set up moderation rules for all content created by users.

### [Reporting for Experience Cloud Sites](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.networks_reporting_intro.htm&type=5)

#### AppEchange Packages

The Salesforce Communities Management packages give community managers an essential starter set of dashboards and reports to keep tabs on activity and engagement directly in Experience Workspaces. You’ll also have the option to give your community managers access to the package contents so you don’t have to share the dashboard and report folders with them later. When you view the dashboards in Experience Workspaces, site-specific data is displayed.

Use **Insight** ~reports~ to view, monitor, and act on your community’s activity. These reports give you a super-focused look at a specific area while helping you with day-to-day community management. Insights can help you prioritize your work and give you instant access to what matters most.
Use **Dashboards** to view your community’s analytics, such as metrics and trends on activity. Dashboards give you mid-term to long-term views on adoption and engagement in your community. They help you monitor return on investment (ROI) and key performance indicators (KPI).

#### Set Up Report Management for External Users

Partner and customer users can create, delete, and edit reports in their own personal folder or, with sufficient permission, in a privately shared folder. You can grant partner and customer users permissions to create and edit reports through their profiles or permission sets. 

#### Google Analytics™ for Salesforce Communities Package

The package contains pre-configured reports that track search activity within an Experience Cloud site. Google Analytics integrates with your self-service Experience Cloud site to track user types, user IDs, pageviews on Salesforce objects, and customer search activity. We’ve also made it possible to turn on Google’s IP Anonymization, if your policies or needs require it.

### [Experience Cloud Sites Managers Guide](https://resources.docs.salesforce.com/latest/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/salesforce_communities_managers_guide.pdf?_ga=2.175830177.2093328585.1659960874-1909944366.1653933554)

To assign a user as an Experience Cloud site manager, simply give them the `Manage Experiences` permission.
You can assign moderators by assigning a permission set that includes one or more of following moderation permissions:

- Moderate Experiences Feeds
- Moderate Experiences Files
- Moderate Experiences Chatter Messages
- Can Approve Feed Post and Comment
- Moderate Experience Users
- Manage Experiences
- Access Experience Management

Experience Cloud site administrators and managers use Experience Management to monitor Experience Cloud site activity, and set up other important management features.

### [Experience Cloud Site Moderation Strategies and Tools](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.69857427.2093328585.1659960874-1909944366.1653933554&type=5&id=sf.networks_moderation_overview.htm)

Moderation allows you to empower members of your Experience Cloud site to monitor content and ensure that it’s appropriate and relevant.

- `Moderation Insights` are arranged in clickable tiles on the Moderation Overview page in Experience Workspaces. View the entire picture of your site’s moderation activity at a glance and take action on day-to-day moderation tasks.
- Turn on flagging for your Experience Cloud site to empower members to flag posts, comments, files, and messages that they deem inappropriate.
- Create content and/or member criteria that define keywords or groups of members. Criteria are used in rules to moderate member-generated content, such as posts and comments.
- Create and modify rules for your Experience Cloud site to moderate member-generated content. Each rule specifies the member-generated content the rule applies to, the criteria to enforce the rule on, and the moderation action to take. Moderation rules help protect your site from spammers, bots, and offensive or inappropriate content.
- Review and Approve Posts and Comments in Your Experience Cloud Site. Posts and comments pending review aren’t displayed in the feed.
- Moderate Flagged Posts and Comments in Your Experience Cloud Site
- Moderate Flagged Discussions in Your Experience Cloud Site
- Moderate Flagged Files in Your Experience Cloud Site
- Moderate Flagged Direct Messages in Your Experience Cloud Site
- Moderate Flagged Private Messages in Your Experience Cloud Site
- Use triggers to create custom advanced moderation logic that automatically flags items in your Experience Cloud site - after insert triggers on FeedItem, FeedComment, ChatterMessage, or ContentDocument

### [Partner Relationship Management](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/partner-relationship-management)

 `Partner Recruitment` App on the AppExchange. This app provides partner recruitment forms with predefined fields or questions, customizable emails that can be sent to potential partners with links to the questionnaire, and response tracking.

 Learning management solution (LMS) apps are available to be drag and dropped as a component into Sales Cloud PRM. You can find these on the AppExchange. Salesforce has a strategic relationship with partners, like Appinium and NetExam, who have created apps that make training a breeze

 ### [Authenticate Experience Cloud Site Users](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.217263766.1049103500.1660399025-742205375.1652543223&type=5&id=sf.networks_authentication_options.htm)

 Options to authenticate users:

 - (By default) log in with username and password
 - SAML
 - 3rd party auth providers
 - OAuth
 - Self-registration with Login Discovery

#### Configure SAML for Experience Cloud Sites

If your Salesforce org already uses SAML single sign-on (SSO) to simplify and standardize your user authentication, you can extend this capability to your Experience Cloud sites. When implementing SAML SSO for Experience Cloud sites, the key is to use the site URL associated with login for the SSO flow. Also make sure that the site URL in the SAML assertion POST includes /login. 

#### Configure Authentication Providers

3rd-party auth providers that support OpenID (e.g. Facebook)

#### Configure Authorization Flows with OAuth

If your org wants to build integrations between Experience Cloud sites and custom-branded apps, such as mobile or desktop apps, you can use OAuth to create a branded login page. Experience Cloud supports all available authorization flows, except for the username-password OAuth authorization flow and the SAML assertion flow. When implementing branded OAuth flows for Experience Cloud sites, you configure the authorize URL to use the site URL. The authorization flow then directs users to the app approval page.

### [Customize Login, Self-Registration, and Password Management for Your Site](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.46752679.1049103500.1660399025-742205375.1652543223&type=5&id=sf.networks_customize_login.htm)

Configure the default login, logout, password management, and self-registration options for your site. Or customize the behavior with Apex and Visualforce or Experience Builder (Site.com Studio) pages. You can also use dynamic URLs to brand your pages at run time. By default, each site comes with default login, logout, password management, and self-registration pages. Salesforce also includes associated Apex controllers that drive this functionality under the hood. You can use Experience Builder or Visualforce to create custom branding and change the default behavior.

#### Customize Login Experience

Use `dynamic branding` URLs to customize the user’s login experience at run time. Dynamic branding applies to the entire login process—the initial login page plus related pages, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), Terms & Conditions, or login flow. You can add dynamic branding to default, Experience Builder, Visualforce, and custom login pages.

Login Discovery Page

- After users enter the identifier, they’re challenged to verify themselves
- If SSO-enabled, Login Discovery can send the user directly to the identity provider login page
- users can identify themselves using an email address or phone number. 
- It also supports custom identifiers, such as an employee number or federation ID, in Apex.

#### Brand Experience Cloi=ud Login Page

You can use your own logo, change background colors, add a custom footer, and even change the content on the right side of the login page.

#### Create Dynamic Branding URLs

For example, you can change which logo to display depending on whether the user is an employee or customer. Or display a particular self-registration page based on the user’s country code. When using dynamic branding to customize the login experience, it applies to the entire login process: the initial login page plus related pages, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) or a login flow. You can add dynamic branding to Experience Builder, Visualforce, and custom login pages.

From the Administration Login & Registration page, you specify the logo URL with the `{expid}`

#### Set Up Self-Registration for Your Experience Cloud Site

Enable self-registration to allow unlicensed guest users to join your site. When your users self-register, you can choose to save them as contacts under a business account or create a person account for each self-registering user.

### [Enable Other Salesforce Features in Experience Cloud Sites](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.50988841.1049103500.1660399025-742205375.1652543223&type=5&id=sf.networks_enable_other_salesforce_features.htm)

#### Cases

When you enable cases for external users in your Experience Cloud site, you can assign cases to those members. Additionally, external members can edit cases, create new cases, add case comments, reassign cases, find case solutions, and create case teams. Determine whether users with Customer Community Plus licenses can view and edit cases in which they are listed as the contact. You can disable the standard sharing behavior that grants the assigned contact and everyone in their role hierarchy access to a case. After disabling this sharing behavior, you can control access to cases by creating a manual share or by using Apex managed sharing.

#### Site Case Feed
With the site case feed, agents and Experience Cloud site members see the life cycle of a case from start to finish. All case interactions appear in a unified, chronological Chatter case feed. Site members benefit from the added functionalities of Chatter, while support-side features help agents provide efficient, personalized support.

#### Chatter Questions

Chatter Questions helps you promote engagement by giving users the ability to ask and answer questions in their Chatter feed, in groups, and in records. Members in your users’ groups and Experience Cloud sites can answer questions in Chatter just as they would comment on a Chatter post. 

#### Emails to Leads and Contacts

Enable the Send Email button, so partner and customer users can send emails to leads and contacts from their Experience Cloud site.

#### Salesforce Knowledge

Enable Salesforce Knowledge to quickly get articles to your customers and agents in an Experience Cloud site. Knowledge articles provide accurate information to customers when and where they need it.

#### Etc.

- Enable Upvotes and Downvotes
- Assign Permission to Verify Answers for Your Company
- Assign Post Pinning Permission
- Question-to-Case

### [Experience Cloud Authentication and Security](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.218194841.1049103500.1660399025-742205375.1652543223&type=5&id=sf.networks_security.htm)

#### Clickjack Protection

- Allow framing by the same origin only (recommended): The default level for Experience Cloud sites. 
- Don’t allow framing by any page (most protection)

#### [Authenticate Experience Cloud Site Users](#authenticate-experience-cloud-site-users-1)

#### Encrypt Experience Cloud Site Data

#### CSP and Lightning Locker

Experience Builder sites use Content Security Policy (CSP) and Lightning Locker to secure your site from malicious attacks and custom code vulnerabilities. CSP is a W3C standard that controls the source of content that can be loaded on your site’s pages and helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Lightning Locker is a Salesforce architectural layer that allows third-party Lightning components and custom code to run safely on the same page in the browser. 

#### Experience Cloud Cookies

By saving a user’s settings, cookies can enhance the user’s experience and the performance of the Experience Cloud site. Salesforce doesn’t currently provide functionality for end-user cookie consent management. The platform is compatible with many existing third-party solutions.

#### Securely Share Your Experience Cloud Sites with Guest Users

Use a guest user profile to control public access to data, content, and objects in your site that don't require authentication. To increase the security of your Salesforce data, guest users are no longer automatically the owner of records they create. Instead, when a guest user creates a record, the record is assigned to a default active user in the org, who becomes the owner.

Set the public access level to your Experience Builder site, and set page-specific access to your site pages. After you configure the guest user profile and the site guest user record, keep object-specific best practices in mind for guest user access.

### [Organize Experience Cloud Sites with Topics](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.networks_topics_overview.htm&type=5)

Use topics to structure your site’s content or highlight key discussions. You can create topics or use the topics that organically emerge from site member posts. Choose navigational topics and subtopics to provide a consistent map of your site. Use featured topics to highlight current, popular conversations. Use content topics to organize your original content. In the site itself, member-created topics let users organize information for each other, creating a personalized experience that boosts site engagement.

#### Topic Metrics

Find metrics on a topic’s detail page. With this information at their fingertips, site members know how current and popular a topic is. Admins can also use these metrics to highlight certain topics in their sites or consolidate similar topics based on usage.

### [Experience Cloud Sites Usage Allocation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&_ga=2.247688071.1049103500.1660399025-742205375.1652543223&type=5&id=sf.networks_usage_allocation.htm)

Experience Cloud site usage is governed by daily, monthly, and yearly allocations. 

- Bandwidth - The number of megabytes served and received from both the community’s origin server and the cache server. This allocation is only calculated for non-authenticated community users.
- Service Request Time - The total server time in minutes required to generate pages for the community. This allocation is only calculated for non-authenticated community users.
- Page View - A request from a non-authenticated community user to load a page associated with your community. Requests from authenticated community users are not counted as page views. 

### [Improve Experience Cloud Site Performance](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.community_designer_performance_overview.htm&type=5)

Enabling Account Role Optimization (ARO) can significantly increase the number of users that a license can accommodate. Tailor your performance tools based on page traffic. Which pages do visitors view most, and how many views are there during high-traffic times? How many views do your pages average?

- For high-volume traffic, the `CDN for Digital Experience` can reduce load times. CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that optimizes routing and stores cached versions of web content. 
- To build a robust and lightweight platform with unparalleled performance, we recommend the `Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) platform`.
- For faster page load times and performance, we recommend `Progressive Rendering`, which improves individual page performance.
- Enable `micro-batching` to create a high-volume of records for Cases, Leads, and Custom Objects. Micro-batching creates these records in batches rather than one at a time. Asynchronously batch processing record creation is an effective way to create object records for high-traffic sites.
- Self-registration is the fastest way to register users to a site. Enable high-volume self-registration using micro-batching to process self-registration requests in batches rather than one at a time, and more effectively handle self-registration loads for high volume-sites.
- Enable `Account Role Optimization` to avoid creating unnecessary roles. It delays account role creation until there’s a second user and roles are necessary to support sharing data.
