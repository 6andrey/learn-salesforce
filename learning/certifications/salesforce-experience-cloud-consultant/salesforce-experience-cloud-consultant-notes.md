You can also use personas to help you articulate who you're not designing for. In some cases, a feature isn’t used by all of your users, and it is helpful to explicitly acknowledge that this group of users doesn’t need to be considered in the design process.

It’s totally OK if at your organization one user maps to multiple personas!

A user story describes a specific task or activity using one of your personas. A user story is told from the persona’s perspective. It includes the persona, one of their top activities, and their motivations and goals to provide more context and make the story come to life.

>  As as  [Persona name]  I want to  [Task I want to do]  so that I  [Impact of completing this task].

`“A (primary) persona must be satisfied by the particular UI, and cannot be satisfied by another persona’s UI.” —Alan Cooper`

Key places where personas can add real value to your company:
1. Smarter roadmap decisions: pusrchasing and licensing, custom features
2. Tailoting user enagagement: trainings, events, activities with users
3. Targeted research: selecting right participants to test `specific` features
